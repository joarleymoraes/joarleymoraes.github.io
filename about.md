### SUMMARY

Hello! My name is Joarley Moraes and I live in Berlin. During the day, I work as full time Backend Developer, across different and interesting projects. On my free time, I like to read, work on my side projects, drink beer, and hang with my friends and family. Graduated college ([UFPa/Brazil](https://portal.ufpa.br/)) with a degree in Computer Engineering, part of which took place in [LTU/Sweden](https://www.ltu.se/?l=en)


I design and implement backend systems. I mainly work with **Python**, **serverless**, **microservices** and **AWS**. I'm fascinated by simple solutions. I enjoy building software products that users want. Forgive me, but I will always want to know the **`Why`**.
